/* Read this file after reading app.js and router.js.

   This is our index.js for the controllers folder. As discussed at the top of
   router.js, the index.js file is a special file in any folder. If someone
   writes code that requries an entire folder, what they are really doing is
   importing the index.js file from that folder. It serves as an interface for
   the folder.

   Normally this controllers folder would have many other files in it, all of
   which would be imported and exported through index.js. However, for now we
   will just put everything in this file.

   We then use the built in response.sendFile() function to send a file back.
   We could potentially just use our static file hosting function from app.js to
   serve all these static html files, but our next demo will look into using views
   and we will want our code broken out like this.

   Functions like res.sendFile() are convenience functions built into the response
   by express. They work similarly to our own respond() function from previous demos.
   They will properly read in the given file, set the headers (including the 
   content-type based on the extension), write the response body, and send the response.

   For example, here we want to send back the notFound.html page with a 404 status code.
   By default, express sends everything with a 200 status code, but we can call the
   res.status() function to change that status code. After we do that, we can just chain on
   our sendFile function to send back the notFound.html file.

   res.status() is not a terminating function, meaning it does not immediately send the response.
   res.sendFile() is, however, a terminating function and it will send the response.
